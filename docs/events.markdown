## Capital in History: Does Marxism Even Matter?

**Oct. 19, 6PM @ CSE 4258**

In this teach-in, we’ll sketch 10,000 years of human history. Hegel thought this was the story of freedom coming into being, complete and culminating with bourgeois society. He died before he could witness it produce its own crisis: capitalism. 

But it also produced its own potential solution—the Left. This was Marx’s great insight. In the 20th century, the Left undertook the Marxian project of socialist revolution—the greatest attempt in history at the self-conscious transformation of society. It failed catastrophically.

More than a century has elapsed. Still Marx weighs on the brains of the living like a nightmare. And they remain open questions and unaccomplished tasks:

*Is the Left relevant today? Will it take up responsibility for this unfinished story of freedom?*



## Society: What is it? What is it for? 

**Oct. 26, 6PM @ CSE 4258**

Rousseau said that we form society when “each of us puts his person and all his power in common under the supreme direction of the general will”. 

And in return, society shall “take from man his own powers, and give him in exchange alien powers which he cannot employ without the help of other men”. Through our mutual interdependence, we gain not only alien powers, but rights, liberties, and life beyond mere existence. 

In short, society grants us *human* life. But this is only one half of the story. 

Marx argues that today, as we reconstitute society, we are “like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells.” The effect is that society at the same time forces upon us *machine* life, mean and unfree. 

To realize our freedom, we must master our alien powers, and the ends to which we call upon them. 

*What is this object we call society? And what is the object of society?*


## The State: Mass Democracy & Authoritarianism

**Nov. 2, 6PM @ CSE 4258**

> The state...is the admission that this society has involved itself in insoluble self-contradiction and is cleft into irreconcilable antagonisms which it is powerless to exorcise. But in order that these antagonisms, classes with conflicting economic interests, shall not consume themselves and society in fruitless struggle, a power, apparently standing above society, has become necessary to moderate the conflict and keep it within the bounds of “order”; and this power...is the state.
>
> &mdash; Frederick Engels, [*The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/index.htm) (1884)

The modern state, even in its totalitarian form, is *mass democratic*: its necessary function is to take up and mitigate the discontents of society. We ourselves demand it, and indeed, the State aims to appear, Marx writes, “as the patriarchal benefactor of all classes.”

But as our discontents stem from society and not the state, it can only mediate the crises---and it does so with an iron fist---yet it cannot overcome them. Thus, mass democracy results not in the perfecting of society for itself, but the perfecting of the *authoritarian state over society*.

*What does the State mean today? What is the relation of the Left to the State?*
