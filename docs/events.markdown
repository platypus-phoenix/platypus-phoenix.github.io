# Teach-In Series Fall 2022
**Wednesdays 6PM @ [CSE 4258](https://goo.gl/maps/tVMUddcYxDXSu8yXA)**

## Oct 19. Capital in History: Does Marxism Even Matter?

In this teach-in, we’ll sketch 10,000 years of human history. Hegel thought this was the story of freedom coming into being, complete and culminating with bourgeois society. He died before he could witness it produce its own crisis: capitalism. 

But it also produced its own potential solution—the Left. This was Marx’s great insight. In the 20th century, the Left undertook the Marxian project of socialist revolution—the greatest attempt in history at the self-conscious transformation of society. It failed catastrophically.

More than a century has elapsed. Still Marx weighs on the brains of the living like a nightmare. And they remain open questions and unaccomplished tasks:

*Is the Left relevant today? Will it take up responsibility for this unfinished story of freedom?*



## Oct 26. Society: What is it? What is it for? 

According to Rousseau, we form society when “each of us puts his person and all his power in common under the supreme direction of the general will”. 

And in return, society shall “take from man his own powers, and give him in exchange alien powers which he cannot employ without the help of other men”. Through our mutual interdependence, we gain not only alien powers, but rights, liberties, and life beyond mere existence. 

In short, society grants us human life. But this appears to be only one half of the story. 

Marx argues that today, as we reconstitute society, we are “like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells.” The effect is that society at the same time forces upon us machine life, mean and unfree. 

To realize our freedom, we must master our alien powers, and the ends to which we call upon them. 

*What is this object we call society? And what is the object of society?*


## Nov 2. Authoritarianism, Mass Democracy, and the State
