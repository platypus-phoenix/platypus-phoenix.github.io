# The Coming Upheaval
**Marx**, from *The Poverty of Philosophy* (1847)

Economic conditions had first transformed the mass of the peopleof the country into workers. The combination of capital has created forthis mass a common situation, common interests. This mass is thus alreadya class as against capital, but not yet for itself. In the struggle, ofwhich we have noted only a few phases, this mass becomes united, and constitutesitself as a class for itself. The interests it defends become class interests.But the struggle of class against class is a political struggle.

An oppressed class is the vital condition for every society foundedon the antagonism of classes. The emancipation of the oppressed class thusimplies necessarily the creation of a new society. For the oppressed classto be able to emancipate itself, it is necessary that the productive powersalready acquired and the existing social relations should no longer becapable of existing side by side. Of all the instruments of production,the greatest productive power is the revolutionary class itself. The organizationof revolutionary elements as a class supposes the existence of all theproductive forces which could be engendered in the bosom of the old society.

Does this mean that after the fall of the old society there willbe a new class domination culminating in a new political power? No.
The condition for the emancipation of the working class is theabolition of every class, just as the condition for the liberation of thethird estate, of the bourgeois order, was the abolition of all estatesand all orders.

The working class, in the course of its development, will substitutefor the old civil society an association which will exclude classes andtheir antagonism, and there will be no more political power properly so-called,since political power is precisely the official expression of antagonismin civil society.

Meanwhile the antagonism between the proletariat and the bourgeoisieis a struggle of class against class, a struggle which carried to its highestexpression is a total revolution. Indeed, is it at all surprising thata society founded on the opposition of classes should culminate in brutalcontradiction, the shock of body against body, as its final denouement?
Do not say that social movement excludes political movement. Thereis never a political movement which is not at the same time social.

It is only in an order of things in which there are no more classesand class antagonisms that *social evolutions* will cease to be *politicalrevolutions*. Till then, on the eve of every general reshuffling ofsociety, the last word of social science will always be:

> “Le combat ou la mort; la lutte sanguinaire ou le neant. C’est ainsique la quéstion est invinciblement posée.” 
> "Combat or death: bloody struggle or extinction. It is thus that the question is inexorably put." 
> --- George Sand, *Jean Ziska. A Historical Novel.*
